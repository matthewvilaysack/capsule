## Inspiration
Capsule was inspired by the need to support elderly individuals facing memory-related challenges and isolation. By providing a space where memories can be revisited and cherished, Capsule aims to bridge the gap created by physical distance and memory loss.

## What it does
Capsule presents a VR memory palace where users can store and revisit mementos sent by loved ones. These memory capsules transport users to environments that reflect the essence of each cherished memory, helping them preserve and recall these moments in a lasting, interactive way.

## How we built it
Built on Unity for Meta Quest 3, Capsule combines Skybox AI, SketchFab, and Meshy to create an optimized low-poly environment. Interface planning was completed in FigJam, focusing on user accessibility and immersive interaction design.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning Unity and Meta Quest 3 development posed technical challenges, especially in managing scene transitions and finding accessible assets. Emphasizing gentle, user-friendly UI designs was crucial to ensuring the experience resonated with elderly users.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully creating an intuitive VR experience that enhances memory recall for elderly users and fosters connection with loved ones was a rewarding accomplishment, especially given our team's limited Unity experience.

## What we learned
Working with VR and AR technology opened new possibilities for addressing real-world needs. Our team's diverse skills came together to create an experience that blends empathy with technology, making Capsule both engaging and beneficial.

## What's next for Capsule
Future development will integrate an LLM-powered chatbot for personalized memory interactions, using Whisper and ElevenLabs for seamless conversational flow. Additional features include audiovisual mementos with music therapy to support memory recall for users with dementia or Alzheimer's.
